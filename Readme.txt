Title: "Unit Root Tests for Panel Data with AR(1) Errors and small T"
Journal: The Econometrics Journal
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1368-423X.2011.00363.x 

===== MAIN FUNCTION =====
The function fBlanderDhaeneModel2.m can be called directly on the panel data. Each column should contain the data the time series of one particular cross-sectional unit. The panel should be balanced and without missing observations.

===== OTHER FILES ====
 - Example.m can be used to replicate results from the simulation section of the paper and thereby illustrates the use of the code.
 - Auxiliary functions are contained in the folder entitled ``functions''. The folder should be added to Matlab's search path.
